## Homework Exercise
As part of the application process, I completed a case study in two parts:

1. **User Funnel Analysis (Python + Power BI)**  
   - Mapped how users progress from listing pages → product pages → add-to-cart → order.  
   - Identified a large drop-off after product pages, highlighting UX, trust, or pricing barriers.  
   - Built KPIs to monitor engagement, drop-offs, and conversion rates over time.  
   - Created an interactive dashboard in Power BI consolidating funnel insights.  

2. **SQL Analysis**  
   - Detected a high daily volume (15k–24k) of users only viewing products in their first session, suggesting UX or incentive gaps.  
   - Found 3.4k unusual orders without page views or cart activity, possibly due to tracking gaps or a direct checkout flow.  
   - Wrote SQL queries to validate funnel metrics and cross-check anomalies.
