## Homework Exercise
As part of the process, I completed a case study with three main tasks:

1. **Revenue Contribution by First-Touch Channel**  
   - Calculated revenue share per traffic source.  
   - Found that Paid Search (17.9%), Direct (17.1%), and Email (17.0%) are the top contributors at the start of the funnel.  

2. **Repeat Purchases Within 30 Days**  
   - Identified that 18.5% of customers made a second purchase within 30 days.  
   - Highlighted retention opportunities through post-purchase and cross-sell campaigns.  

3. **Campaign Performance by ROAS**  
   - Evaluated campaigns by advertising efficiency.  
   - Newsletter (ROAS 0.69) and Google Ads Black Friday (ROAS 0.67) underperformed.  
   - Spring Sale (ROAS 2.72) and Instagram Summer Deal (ROAS 2.71) were strong and should continue receiving investment.
