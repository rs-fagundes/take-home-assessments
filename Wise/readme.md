## Homework Exercise
As part of the process, I delivered a case study with two components:

### 1. Payment Operations Performance & Insights Report (MI Pack):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Reviewed six months of data from Global Payments Processing and Regional Payment Operations.  
- Key insights:  
  - **Wait Time Buckets:** Global Linking consistently outperformed Global DU; DU faced delays in 24h–48h buckets.  
  - **Escalations:** September showed critical spikes; DU escalations grew fivefold compared to Q2.  
  - **Regional Performance:** NorthAm and JPYKRW led in efficiency; Europe Ops and GBP underperformed.  
- Recommendations:  
  - Apply Global Linking best practices to DU to improve 1h and 4h buckets.  
  - Investigate and resolve root causes of September escalation peaks.  
  - Address inefficiencies in Europe Ops and GBP with targeted workflow improvements.  
  - Scale NorthAm/JPYKRW successes to other regions.  

### 2. SQL Query Task:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Designed a schema with **user_locations**, **transactions**, and **currency_rates** tables.  
- Wrote a query to calculate the top 5 countries by cross-currency transaction volume in GBP equivalent for 2020.  
- Query includes filtering for cross-currency transactions, year selection, and aggregation with conversion rates.
