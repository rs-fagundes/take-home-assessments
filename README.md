# Take-Home Assessments for Job Applications

This repository contains take-home assessments and coding challenges I completed as part of application processes for various companies. These projects showcase my problem-solving skills, technical expertise, and ability to work on real-world scenarios within limited time frames.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to document my journey through different opportunities, share insights from the challenges I've faced, and track my progress as a professional. Each folder contains a challenge for a specific company, including the instructions (when applicable), my implementation, and any additional notes.

## Structure
The repository is organized into folders, each named after the company for which the challenge was completed:

- `Autodoc/`: Challenge for Autodoc
- `Bolt/`: Challenge for Bolt
- `Wise/`: Challenge for Wise
