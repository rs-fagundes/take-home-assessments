   - Objective: increase conversion within 14 days post-install.  
   - Expected uplift: **+10% conversion**, equating to an estimated **$300K–$450K/month in additional revenue**:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

   - Defined and validated Braze events (e.g., `onboarding_started`, `activity_completed`).

4. **Journey Design**  
   - Designed a 14-day flow with tailored touchpoints across email, push, and in-app messages.  
   - Example: Day 0 Welcome email → Day 3 Progress update → Day 7 Upgrade prompt → Day 13 Final incentive.  

5. **Testing & Optimization**  
   - Proposed A/B tests on subject lines, CTA copy, progress reporting formats, and final offers (discount vs free trial).  
   - Outlined KPIs: free→paid conversion, session frequency, retention (Day 7 & Day 14), and channel engagement (open/click rates).
