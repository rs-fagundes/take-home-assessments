## Homework Exercise
As part of the application process, I delivered a case study in two parts:  

### 1. Peak Hour Problem (Supply & Demand Analysis)  
- Analyzed demand-supply gaps across different hours of the day.  
- Identified critical undersupply periods (early mornings, morning commutes, evening peaks).  
- Calculated additional online driver hours needed to reach 100% coverage.  
- Modeled guaranteed earnings and compensation required to attract drivers during peak hours.  
- Recommended targeted incentives and bonus schemes to reduce missed demand and improve rider satisfaction.  

### 2. Scaling Growth Analytics (Operational Support & Automation)  
- Highlighted that Bolt operates in 600 cities but campaigns were manually managed in only 100.  
- Proposed a **Campaign Management Platform** to automate rider discounts and driver bonuses at scale.  
- Key features:  
  - Dynamic incentives and templates.  
  - Real-time data integration and dashboards.  
  - Fraud prevention mechanisms.  
  - Local market adaptation and compliance.  
- Defined success metrics: campaign ROI, rider engagement, driver activity, demand-supply improvements, and market share growth.  
- Outlined next steps: pilot in 50 cities, collect feedback, progressively roll out, and continuously optimize.
