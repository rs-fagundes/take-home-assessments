## Homework Exercise
As part of the application process, I completed a case study divided into three parts:

1. **Spreadsheet Formulas & Formatting (Google Sheets)**  
   - Validated and applied correct formulas for key metrics: Rides, GMV, ASP, Commission %, Net Rate %, EBITDA, and EBITDA % of GMV.  
   - Corrected inconsistencies (e.g., misspelling of “Commission”, percentage formats).  
   - Created a “Country to Region Map” to enable regional grouping and applied conditional formatting for better visualization.  
   - [Spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15U8vTXwlxqysytAGqDIl2OE52IafyWpJhH5PfTem-iU/edit?usp=sharing).  

2. **Apps Script Automation**  
   - Replicated and pre-filled a “Regional Review File” template.  
   - Exported one file per region (North, West, Center, South, Rest) with irrelevant rows removed.  
   - Managed formatting limitations inherent to Google Apps Script.  
   - [Regional files folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17p6MVaKwG6HZUfI4iBVM6h_0iZ7elnxX?usp=sharing).  

3. **Market Analysis Report (Python)**  
   - Analyzed ride-level data (DataRides) to calculate key KPIs: rides, GMV, ASP, EBITDA, revenue per ride, average distance/duration.  
   - Found that most revenue is concentrated in the morning peak (7–11am) and on Saturdays.  
   - Highlighted opportunities to:  
     - Focus marketing on morning commuters.  
     - Optimize driver supply for mornings and weekends.  
     - Explore strategies to increase off-peak usage.  
     - Refine pricing during peak hours.
